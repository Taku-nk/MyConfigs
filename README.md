# vim_config
This is my vim configuration
- YCM code completion
- C++, Python development
- Doom-Emacs-like keybindings
- Works on both Windows and Linux

## Requirements
- You need "bundle" plugin
- You need ~/vimfiles/undodir
- C++ completion depends on compile_command.json generated by CMake
- YCM server needs specific version of python (this is different from python in virtual environment)
- You need MSVC and CMake to build YCM
